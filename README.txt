README file (Reinier de Ridder en Daphne Rietvelt):

To run the program, run SingleFile.py or OOFiles/Corsi.py

We didn't used any additional libraries. 
Since it's a large program, Spyder may have troubles with running this properly. 
Our advise is to use Anaconda2 in combination with PyCharm. 

Besides the basic functionality we added some functionality. The list of additional functionality can be seen below:
- We used Object Oriented Programming
- We used buttons instead of key presses
- The buttons are made interactive. If you hover over the buttons they light up.
- Intitials, age and gender of the participants are also recorded and stored in the CSV file
- The storing of data into CSV file is done using panda dataframes
- We used boxplots as additional statistics
- Instructions are given in text at the bottom of the screen
- The first trial has a 5 seconds waiting time before showing the sequence to read the instructions at the bottom
- During a trial, if you hover over the blocks, they will be dark yellow to indicate that they are clickable. 
- We used dictonaries in our code, for example to store the data into a variable
- We recorded for each trial the trial time and the average of that will be shown at the goodbye screen. (The wrong sequences are not used)
- We did extensive commenting
- We made use of GitHub to store our code and share it with one another
